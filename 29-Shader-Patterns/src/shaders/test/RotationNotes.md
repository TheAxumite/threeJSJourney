Certainly! The code snippet you've provided is performing a 3D rotation transformation of a point in space. The rotation is around the X-axis, and it's using trigonometric functions to calculate the new position of a point after the rotation. Let's break it down:

### The Original Point

- `position` is a `vec3`, which means it's a 3-dimensional vector that has x, y, and z components.
- `position.x`, `position.y`, and `position.z` are the original coordinates of the point before the rotation.

### The Rotation

- `rotation` is a float value that represents the angle of rotation in radians. In 3D graphics, angles are typically measured in radians when it comes to trigonometric calculations.

### Trigonometric Functions

- `cos(rotation)` and `sin(rotation)` are the cosine and sine of the rotation angle, respectively. These are fundamental functions in trigonometry that relate angles to the sides of a right-angled triangle.

### The Transformed Point

The new coordinates of the point after rotation are being calculated as follows:

1. **X Coordinate (`position.x`)**: 
   - It remains unchanged because the rotation is around the X-axis. When you rotate something around an axis, the coordinates on that axis do not change.

2. **Y Coordinate**: 
   - It is calculated using the formula `position.y * cos(rotation) + position.z * sin(rotation)`.
   - This part of the formula, `position.y * cos(rotation)`, scales the original Y coordinate by the cosine of the angle, essentially "compressing" or "stretching" it depending on the angle's value.
   - The `position.z * sin(rotation)` part effectively rotates the Z coordinate into the Y plane. It's determining how much of the point's Z position will influence the new Y position.

3. **Z Coordinate**: 
   - It is calculated using `position.y * -sin(rotation) + position.z * cos(rotation)`.
   - The `-sin(rotation)` part reflects the point across the YZ plane, contributing to the rotation effect. This negative sign is what makes the rotation clockwise when looking from the positive X-axis towards the origin.
   - The `position.z * cos(rotation)` part, similar to the Y coordinate calculation, scales the original Z coordinate by the cosine of the angle.

### Putting It All Together

The entire transformation rotates the point around the X-axis. If you were to visualize it:
- Imagine a horizontal rod going through all points along the X-axis.
- Now, take the point with coordinates (x, y, z) and rotate it around this rod.
- The Y and Z coordinates will change according to the angle of rotation, but the X coordinate will stay the same because the rotation is around the X-axis.

### Visualizing the Trigonometry

Here's a way to visualize what the sine and cosine functions are doing in this context:
- **Cosine (`cos`)**: Imagine a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of a graph. If you were to draw a line from the center of the circle to the edge at an angle `rotation` from the positive X-axis, the X-coordinate where it touches the circle is `cos(rotation)`.
- **Sine (`sin`)**: Using the same circle, the Y-coordinate where that line touches the circle is `sin(rotation)`.

By multiplying the original Y and Z coordinates with these values, you're effectively "rotating" them around the circle, which is exactly what's happening in a 3D rotation around an axis.
